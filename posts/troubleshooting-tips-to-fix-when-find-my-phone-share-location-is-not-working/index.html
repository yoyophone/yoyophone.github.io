A1: Firstly, make sure that you switch on the location settings on your phone and then open the &lsquo;Find My Phone&rsquo; app. Check if Find My Phone is accessing your location correctly. If it isn&rsquo;t, try resetting the app or reinstalling it on your device.</p><p>Q2: How to fix the Find My Phone share location if it still doesn&rsquo;t work after resetting?
A2: Try signing out and back into your account again. If this still doesn&rsquo;t work, try using an alternate service to locate your device such as &lsquo;Google Maps&rsquo; or &lsquo;Find My Device&rsquo;.</p><p>Q3: What should I do if Find My Phone share location still isn&rsquo;t working after resetting and alternate services are also not able to locate my phone?

A4: You can try to reset the Wi-Fi router&rsquo;s password by pressing the reset button at the back of the router. You will need to check with your internet service provider to find out what the default password is.</p><p>Q5: Is there any other way to use Find My Phone share location if all troubleshooting doesn&rsquo;t work?
