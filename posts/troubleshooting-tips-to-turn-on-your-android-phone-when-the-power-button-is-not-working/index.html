It becomes even more challenging when you are dealing with a device whose power button is not responding. Fortunately, there are still ways to turn on your Android phone even without the power button. Connecting your Android phone to a computer and using a suitable software can help you to get your device working.\nFirst, you need to choose the right USB cable for your phone.

You can also customize the button in the settings, so you have added convenience when turning on your phone.\nAnother option to turn on your device without a physical power button is to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

This tutorial will show you how to connect your Android phone to computer and troubleshoot it.
Firstly, you need to prepare a USB cable, connect it between your phone and computer. Once the connection is established, your computer will detect it as a media device and a notification should be displayed on your phone&rsquo;s screen.

Thirdly, you should launch Android Studio on your computer. Look for the “Tools” menu at the top. Then, select the “Android” option and then click on the “Device Manager”. This will allow you to view the connected phone on your computer.
Lastly, you can access your phone&rsquo;s internal memory and diagnose the problem. You can run diagnostic tests to identify any problems with the hardware or software. After you have identified the problem, you can then apply the necessary fixes.</p><h2 id=3-using-third-party-applications-to-control-your-phone-without-power-button>3. Using Third-Party Applications to Control Your Phone without Power Button<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-using-third-party-applications-to-control-your-phone-without-power-button>#</a></h2><p>Troubleshooting tips to turn on your Android phone when the power button is not working can be quite difficult to figure out. Thankfully, there are a few third-party applications to help you out. One of the most widely used apps is “Button Savior”, which can be downloaded from the Google Play store. This app provides a virtual power button on your home screen to allow you to turn on your device. You can also customize the button in the settings, so you have added convenience when turning on your phone.</p><p>Another option to turn on your device without a physical power button is to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). ADB can be used with a USB cable connection to a computer to send commands to your device. This can be done with the command “adb reboot”, which will cause the device to turn on. However, the user must have an unlocked bootloader and enabled USB debugging on the device for this process to work.</p><p>If none of the above methods work for you, you can always take your phone to the manufacturer to have it serviced. This is usually the last resort and may require additional costs, but it is an option if all else fails.</p><p>Overall, if you find yourself facing the problem of not being able to turn on your Android device due to a faulty power button, there are various solutions available with the help of third-party applications and ADB. These options may require some setup, but they can be extremely useful in getting your device back to working condition.</p><h3 id=1-utilizing-third-party-applications>1.

You can&rsquo;t turn your phone on or off, or access other menus. Luckily, there are third-party applications that can help you. In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to turn on your Android phone when the power button is not working.</p><p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install a third-party application like Power Button to Volume Button. These applications allow you to control your phone by using the volume button instead of the power button. Once the application is installed, you&rsquo;ll need to grant it access to access your phone’s settings.</p><p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to set the application up as your default home button. To do this, you&rsquo;ll need to go into your phone&rsquo;s settings and go to the Accessibility section. Once there, you&rsquo;ll need to enable the app and set it as the default home button.</p><p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll need to activate the application. All you need to do is press the volume buttons on your phone and it will open up the application. From there, you&rsquo;ll be able to control your phone just like you normally would with the power button.</p><p>Hopefully this tutorial has helped you control your phone without power button.
