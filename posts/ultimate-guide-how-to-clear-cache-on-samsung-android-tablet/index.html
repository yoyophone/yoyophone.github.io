Cache, short for memory cache, is a form of computer data storage where frequently-used items are stored so as to speed up retrieval when they are needed again. Over time, however, accumulated cache can slow down an Android tablet, fill up memory, or cause various problems. Fortunately, clearing the cache is easy and takes only a few minutes.</p><p>For Android tablets running on Samsung&rsquo;s TouchWiz operating system, users can clear their caches in the settings menu. Once there, simply select the “Apps” tab, then tap the “All” tab and find the list of applications. Once you have found the applications, select the one you want to clear the cache for and tap “Clear Data”. Doing this will clear the cache for that application.</p><p>It is also possible to clear the cache of all applications in one go. To do this, press the Menu button and select “Settings”. In the settings menu, select “More” and then “Application Manager”. From this menu, select the “All” tab and tap “Clear Cache.” This will clear the cache for all applications simultaneously.</p><p>Finally, users can clear their browser caches. Browsers generally have an option for clearing the cache in the settings, and this is the same for Samsung Android tablets. To do this, open the browser and press the Menu button. From here, select “Settings” and then “Clear Cache.” Doing this will clear all the temporary files stored in your browser.</p><p>Following these steps will help ensure that your Samsung Android tablet runs smoothly and is as efficient as possible.
