Setting Up Android OS to Run on VirtualBox<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-setting-up-android-os-to-run-on-virtualbox>#</a></h2><p>Installing Android OS on your PC can be a great way to get access to a broader range of Android apps, as well as creating a safe environment for testing app development. VirtualBox is a great way to achieve this, providing a virtual environment on your PC with a range of features that Android’s Compatibility Layer does not offer. Here’s a guide on how to set up Android OS to run on VirtualBox.</p><p>Firstly, download and install VirtualBox onto your computer. Then, download the latest version of Android x86 from a source such as Android-x86.org. After that, open VirtualBox and click &lsquo;New&rsquo; to create a new virtual machine. Give it a name and select a version that corresponds to your Android version.</p><p>Next, select the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the virtual environment. It depends on the version of Android you are going to install, but for Android 6.0 Marshmallow you should allocate at least 1GB of RAM. Once you’ve done that, click on the &lsquo;Create&rsquo; button.</p><p>Now, you can start the Android OS installation process. Select the downloaded Android ISO file in the virtual machine settings. You’ll then be prompted to select the installation options and complete the installation process. Once complete, your Android OS will be ready to run on your VirtualBox.</p><p>Finally, you can install the Google Play Store, if you want to. This can be done by downloading and installing the latest version of Google Apps. You may also want to run some apps on your virtual Android machine - these can be downloaded and installed like any other app. With that, you’ve now successfully installed Android OS on your PC with VirtualBox.</p><h3 id=1-downloading-the-android-os-image>1. Downloading the Android OS Image<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-downloading-the-android-os-image>#</a></h3><p>Running Android on VirtualBox is possible, allowing you to use the mobile operating system on your computer.
