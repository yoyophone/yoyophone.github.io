Setting Up AirPods Pro<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-setting-up-airpods-pro>#</a></h3><p>Having stable connections is essential if you want to use your airpods pro with android phone. Here are some tips you should consider to ensure that your airpods pro is connected to your android phone for a long time:</p><p>First, make sure that you are using the latest version of the android OS. Some older versions may not be compatible with your airpods pro. Also, ensure that the Bluetooth settings are enabled on your android device.</p><p>Second, make sure that your airpods pro is fully charged before using them.

The closer the two are, the better the connection will be. However, keep in mind that if the distance is too great, you could experience a disconnection.</p><p>Finally, it is important to regularly clean the airpods and the charging case. Dust and other particles can build up over time and interfere with the connection. To properly clean your airpods, use a clean, dry cloth and wipe them down with gentle movements. For best results, use a cotton swab to clean the small areas.</p><h3 id=2-establishing-a-stable-connection>2.
