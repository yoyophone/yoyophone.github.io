USB Debugging is a feature embedded into the Android Operating System that allows users to communicate with their devices over USB connections for the purpose of development, debugging, and file transfer. It enables users to access advanced sections of their phone that are not readily available under normal circumstances.</p><p>Q2. How do I enable USB Debugging for a broken screen?</p><p>A2. To enable USB Debugging for a broken screen, you will need to access the Developer Options on your device. This can be done by connecting the device to a Windows or Mac computer with a USB cable and using various input commands to access the settings.</p><p>Q3. What commands are used to access the Developer Options?</p><p>A3. Depending on the type of device, different input commands must be used to access the Developer Options. For example, for Samsung devices, the command is &ldquo;adb shell input keyevent 82&rdquo;; for HTC, the command is &ldquo;adb shell input keyevent 4&rdquo;.</p><p>Q4. What is the next step after accessing the Developer Options?</p><p>A4. Once the Developer Options have been accessed, you will need to enable USB Debugging by navigating to the Settings menu, then selecting the option that reads &ldquo;Developer Options&rdquo;. There, you will find a toggle switch to enable USB Debugging.</p><p>Q5. Is there anything else I need to do to complete the process?</p><p>A5. Once USB Debugging is enabled, you will need to grant permission for the device to be unlocked. To do this, you will need to go back to the Settings menu, select Security, then select Unknown Sources. After selecting this option, select OK to confirm the selection. Once all of these steps are complete, you will be able to unlock your device with a USB connection.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yoyophone.github.io/posts/how-to-turn-off-android-emergency-sos-feature-when-activated/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Turn Off Android Emergency SOS Feature When Activated</span></a>
