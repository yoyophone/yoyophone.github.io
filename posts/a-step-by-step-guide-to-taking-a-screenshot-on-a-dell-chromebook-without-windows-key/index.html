Other models of Chromebooks may require a different combination of keys in order to capture a screenshot.\nOnce you have identified the keys or key combination on your Chromebook model, you can easily take a screenshot. Your screenshot will be taken and saved to the “Downloads” folder for you to view or share as needed. You may also choose to open the screenshot in an image editor to make modifications.\nWhen taking a screenshot on a Dell Chromebook without a Windows key, it’s important to know that the screenshot will be taken of the entire screen.

This can be done by simply right-clicking the file in the “Downloads” folder, and selecting the “Share” option. This will open up a window where the user can choose the desired method of sharing.\n3. Setting Up Your Chromebook Before starting to take a screenshot on a Dell Chromebook, it is important to check the Chromebook model and features. Chromebooks come with various features and it is best to check which model you own. For example, some Chromebooks come with a dedicated windows key, while some do not.

For example, some Chromebooks support a combination of keys to take a screenshot, while some may require a third-party app. In the case of third-party apps, users should make sure to install a reputable app from the web store.\nAnother important thing to consider is the file format of the screenshot. Most Chromebooks come with a default file format for screenshots, such as .Png. Users should adjust the screenshot settings accordingly to save the screenshot in the desired format.\nFinally, users should consider the storage space required to store the screenshots.
