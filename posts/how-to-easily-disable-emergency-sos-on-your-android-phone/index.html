Understanding SOS Mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-understanding-sos-mode>#</a></h3><p>Many Android users are unsure how to turn off the Emergency SOS feature on their phone. This feature, when enabled, will automatically call the emergency services when the user presses the Power/Sleep button three times in a row. While this feature can be very useful in an emergency, it can be inconvenient and even dangerous when you accidentally trigger it due to a button press while your phone is in your pocket. Fortunately, turning this feature off is easy and doesn&rsquo;t require any root access. Here&rsquo;s how to turn off Emergency SOS on your Android phone.</p><p>Firstly, open your phone&rsquo;s settings menu and select &lsquo;Software & Security&rsquo;. From there, tap &lsquo;Emergency SOS&rsquo; and select &lsquo;Turn Off&rsquo;. This will disable the emergency auto-dial. However, it is recommended to leave the &lsquo;Alert for high volume of emergency calls&rsquo; setting to on, as this will alert you if you are pressing the Power/Sleep button too many times in a row.</p><p>Next, you will need to disable the Power/Sleep button/feature of your device. To do this, go back to the Software & Security menu and tap the &lsquo;Power/Sleep&rsquo; option. From there, turn off the &lsquo;Power/Sleep&rsquo; option. This will prevent the user from accidentally calling emergency services if they press the Power/Sleep button while their phone is in their pocket.</p><p>Finally, you may want to consider disabling the emergency contacts feature as well. This will allow you to customize the contacts that you would like to be contacted in the event of an emergency. To do this, go to the &lsquo;Emergency Contacts&rsquo; menu under Software & Security and tap &lsquo;Disable Emergency Contacts&rsquo;. This will disable the Emergency contacts, removing the contacts that were previously set up for emergency use.</p><p>These steps will ensure that your phone does not accidentally call the emergency services. While the Emergency SOS feature can be very useful in an emergency, it is important to make sure that the feature is disabled when not in use. With these simple steps, you can easily turn off Emergency SOS on your Android phone.</p><h3 id=2-steps-for-disabling-sos-on-your-android-phone>2.
