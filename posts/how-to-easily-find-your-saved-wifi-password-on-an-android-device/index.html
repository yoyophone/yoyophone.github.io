Locate Saved WiFi Password on Android Troubleshooting tips are essential to finding any saved WiFi password on an Android device. The first step is to log into the device’s router. Go to the security tab and locate the Wi-Fi password. If the password is not visible, it can be found by accessing the router’s control panel. This can be done through a web browser.
