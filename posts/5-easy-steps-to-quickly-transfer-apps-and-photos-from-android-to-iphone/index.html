Transferring Photos from Android to iPhone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-transferring-photos-from-android-to-iphone>#</a></h3><p>Transferring photos from an Android device to an Apple iPhone can be an easy task when you know how to do it. Fortunately, there are several ways to do so. To save time, the most convenient way is by using a third-party app such as Google Photos or Transferring My Data. Google Photos works best if you are obsessed with organizing your photos, as you can easily transfer your Android photos to your iPhone. Transfer My Data is convenient as it transfers photos, contacts, and other data from your Android device to your iPhone.</p><p>If you do not want to use a third-party app, you can also transfer photos from your Android device to your iPhone by connecting both devices to your computer. On your computer, you can access the DCIM folder on both your Android device and iPhone and drag your photos from the Android device to the iPhone&rsquo;s DCIM folder.</p><p>You can also transfer photos to your iPhone from your Android device via the cloud. All you have to do is create an account at iCloud, Google Photos, Dropbox or any other cloud storage provider and upload photos from your Android device. Then go to your iPhone and download the photos from that cloud storage service.</p><p>Using AirDrop is also a great way to transfer photos from your Android device to your iPhone. All you have to do is activate the AirDrop function on both the Android device and the iPhone and then select which photos you want to transfer. Your photos will automatically appear on the iPhone after the transfer is complete.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvHJ7-zGlio style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
