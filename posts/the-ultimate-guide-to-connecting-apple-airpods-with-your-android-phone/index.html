Pair Apple AirPods with Android Phone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-pair-apple-airpods-with-android-phone>#</a></h3><p>Connecting Apple AirPods to an Android device is easy but may require some extra steps. First, make sure your Android device supports Bluetooth LE. Once you know it does, make sure the Bluetooth of your Android device is turned on. From there, you can hold the button on the back of the AirPods&rsquo; charging case until the LED changes color to white. Then open the Bluetooth settings of your Android device and choose your AirPods from the list. Finally, select Pair and you&rsquo;ll be connected in no time. Once connected, you can listen to your favourite tunes straight from your Android phone.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgieZWL2uOg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q 1: What are Apple AirPods?
