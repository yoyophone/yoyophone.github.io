Steps for Managing App Permissions on Android Devices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-steps-for-managing-app-permissions-on-android-devices>#</a></h2><p>Managing app permissions on Android devices can be a tricky business. However, with a few easy steps, you can start taking control of what permissions your apps have access to. First, open the Settings app on your device and access the Apps & Notifications menu. Here, you can see a full list of the apps on your device. Select the app you want to manage permissions for and scroll down to the Permissions section.

You can also control which apps can access each category, so you can ensure that only the apps you trust have access to your personal data.</p><p>In addition, you can also take control of the permissions for newly installed apps. Open the Settings app and head to the Apps & Notifications menu. Under the Advanced section, you&rsquo;ll find the Install Unknown Apps option. This is where you can review which apps can install unknown apps from unknown sources. It&rsquo;s a good idea to only allow trusted apps to do this.</p><p>Finally, you should also pay attention to the requests for additional permissions that apps may make. If an app requests additional permissions, you should take the time to read what data the app is asking to access and determine if you&rsquo;re comfortable with it. If not, you can deny the request.
