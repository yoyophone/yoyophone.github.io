To do this, open up the app and select the Settings option. Once you’re there, look for a tab labeled Voice Activation and toggle it off.\nFinally, if your phone has an additional voice assistant like Bixby or Cortana, you can also turn that off from the same place you disabled your Google Assistant.

After that, you won’t be able to use the voice command feature on your phone.\nIn conclusion, turning off the voice assistant on your Android phone is easy to do. All you have to do is open up the Settings, go to the Apps tab, select the voice assistant and toggle it off. You can also turn off the voice activation feature on third-party apps and additional voice assistants.
